st.header("Context")
st.write("""
In the hospitality industry, web reservations are the trend, offering convenience to travelers and expanded reach to hotels. However, this shift has led to a significant wave of booking cancellations that challenges hotel operations and revenue management. Studies have reported that 19% of cancellations come from a hotel's website, 39% from Booking.com, and 25% from Expedia over a four-month period.

Several factors contribute to these high cancellation rates:
- **Multiple Bookings:** Guests often reserve rooms at multiple hotels and finalize their decision closer to the arrival date, which increases the likelihood of cancellations.
- **Free Cancellation Policies:** The availability of free cancellation encourages guests to book without long-term commitment, leading to higher cancellation rates.
- **Unforeseen Events:** Situations such as bad weather, strikes, technical failures, or personal emergencies can disrupt travel plans, resulting in last-minute cancellations.
