## Project Overview 

In the hospitality industry, online reservations have become the norm‚Äîproviding convenience for guests and broader reach for hotels. However, this shift has led to a high volume of booking cancellations, which negatively impact hotel operations and revenue. Studies have shown:
- 19% of cancellations originate from hotel websites,
- 39% from Booking.com,
- 25% from Expedia over a four-month period.

### Why Do Guests Cancel?
- Guests often book multiple hotels and make a final decision closer to the arrival date.
- Free cancellation options promote low-commitment bookings.
- Unexpected events (e.g., weather, strikes, emergencies) can force last-minute cancellations.

### Problem Background & Stakeholders
Booking cancellations disrupt planning and profitability. Key stakeholders include:
- **Hotel Management**: Minimizing revenue loss.
- **Revenue Teams**: Need accurate forecasts for pricing and occupancy planning.
- **Marketing Teams**: Segment guests and reduce cancellations.
- **Strategy Teams**: Use insights to develop data-driven policies.

## Analytical Approach

### Evaluating Model Performance: False Positives vs. False Negatives

Understanding errors in prediction helps mitigate business risks:

#### False Positives (FP)
- **What it means**: The model predicts a cancellation, but the guest actually arrives.
- **Impact**: Unnecessary retention efforts (e.g., discounts or promotions).

#### False Negatives (FN)
- **What it means**: The model fails to predict a cancellation.
- **Impact**:
  - Empty rooms despite operational preparations.
  - Missed opportunities to rebook and recover revenue.

**Conclusion**: **False Negatives are more critical** due to direct revenue loss and planning inefficiencies.

### Evaluation Metrics

- **Recall**: Most important to capture as many actual cancellations as possible.
- **F2 Score**: Prioritizes recall over precision, useful when false negatives are more costly.

## Data Understanding

- **Dataset**: [Hotel Booking Demand ‚Äì Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/jessemostipak/hotel-booking-demand/data)
- **Size**: 119,389 booking records
- **Target Variable**: `is_canceled`  
  - `1`: Booking was canceled  
  - `0`: Booking was honored

### Key Features

| Feature | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `lead_time` | Days between booking and arrival |
| `adr` | Average Daily Rate |
| `hotel` | Hotel type: Resort or City |
| `customer_type` | Transient, Contract, Group, etc. |
| `is_repeated_guest` | Whether the guest is a return visitor |
| `previous_cancellations` | Number of past canceled bookings |
| `booking_changes` | Number of changes made to booking |
| `deposit_type` | No Deposit, Refundable, or Non-Refundable |
| ... | [`See project notebook for full list`](https://github.com/kevinrioharris/Hotel_Booking_Demand/blob/main/Hotel_Booking_Demand_Analysis.ipynb) |

## Modelling

We compared six classification algorithms with two undersampling methods:

### Algorithms:
- Logistic Regression
- K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
- Decision Tree
- Random Forest
- LightGBM
- XGBoost

### Resampling Methods:
- Random Undersampling
- SMOTE (Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique)

---

## Results

- **Best Model**: **Random Forest + Random Undersampling**
- **F2 Score**: **79%**
- **Recall**: **88%**
- **Top Feature**: `lead_time` ‚Äì Guests with longer lead times are more likely to cancel.
- **Cost Impact**:
  - **Before ML**: $802,510
  - **After ML**: $267,150  
  ‚Üí **Up to 60% cost reduction achieved using ML**
